# gesdisc-cloud-tutorials
This repository is a starter kit for demonstrating methods of cloud access with Earthdata Cloud + GES DISC datasets.


These tutorials are based on work done by the NASA DAAC Mentors and Openscapes. The original tutorials are found in this [NASA Openscapes Earthdata Cloud AGU Workshop repository](https://github.com/NASA-Openscapes/2021-Cloud-Workshop-AGU/tree/main/tutorials) and [website](https://nasa-openscapes.github.io/2021-Cloud-Workshop-AGU/tutorials/).
